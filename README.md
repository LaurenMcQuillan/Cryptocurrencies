# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if Accountability Accounting should offer cryptocurrency investment portfolios to their customers. The cryptocurrency data first needed to be cleaned in order to get it ready for unsupervised machine learning. Once the data was cleaned, unsupervised machine learning was performed to determine what cryptocurrencies are currently on the market, and how they can be grouped into a classification system that is beneficial to Accountability Accounting.
